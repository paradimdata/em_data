sample TEM data from 2017 PARADIM Summer School:

From David Muller: 

"Tutorial 3 is for tomography - tomviz is an open-source tomography tool that we developed at Cornell, in collaboration with Kitware.  It is optimized for materials tomography. 
IMOD is intended for biology so less appropriate for PARADIM

Tutorial 4 is for EELS data sets.  This describes how to install and use our Java (sorry about that) plugins, and has example dm3 EELS data sets

Tutorial 5 is for EMPAD data.  Again using our CSI plugins. We are currently dumping the data out as a raw file.   We have plans to adopt the Nexus HDF format, but have not done so yet."
